# EE5301

These are my projects for EE5301 which was a VLSI Design Automation class. In these assignments, we were usually implementing some type
of VLSI design algorithm used in VLSI design tools.

## PA0

A Basic circuit file parser. Parse a bunch of gates and their delay and skew values.

## PA1

Used the Circuit parser from PA0 and created an adjacency list of the gates. It then evaluated the timing of the corresponding circuit.

## PA2

Used an Annealing Algorithm to floorplan a chip.
